What is a Light Probe?
The light probe is designed to serve as an educational aid for visually impaired students, enabling them to conduct scientific experiments independently. The device employs an astable multivibrator circuit, which generates a square wave signal whose frequency can be modulated by a variable resistor. And since we are interested in light intensities, we used a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) as the variable resistor. The device generates tones of different frequencies as the incident light intensity changes. It can be used in experiments where the light intensities change due to variations in material properties, such as transparency or refractive index, as well as obstructions in the light path.
What can it do?
It can help the user get a sense of direction of the light source and get a qualitative estimate of the light intensity. 
How does it know how much light is out there?
The light probe uses a photosensitive resistor or Light Dependent Resistor(LDR) with a range of 1 KOhms to 100 KOhms. The resistance of the LDR goes down when the incident light intensity increases, and vice versa. 
How does it give you directional information?
The LDR is enclosed in an opaque tube, which limits the directions from which the incident light can fall on the LDR. Since the tube is protruding out of the enclosure, the user will be able to tell the direction by feeling the orientation of the tube.
